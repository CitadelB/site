Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks   - The Times 03/Jan/2009   This headline from the ‘The Times’ will be forever written in the first block of Bitcoin’s blockchain, as a digital monument carved in Cyberspace to remind us that centralization comes with a big price.\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, our world was going into an economic crisis caused by corrupt and greedy banks and politicians. It isn’t the first time in human history that institutions and governments have gambled with trust and with the power given to them by the people, and it won’t be the last time either!\nAs Lord Acon said: “All power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely!”\nOur history is filled with endless cycles of centralized entities accumulating more and more power from the people, and becoming increasingly corrupt as a result. This is true for all centralized institutions. No matter how noble or pure those centralized entities are in the beginning, through time, as they accumulate more and more power, they become more and more corrupt. This happens through a positive feedback loop until corruption becomes so great that everyone becomes threatened by such centralized entities. And we know how this all ends eventually. Throughout whole human history there have been riots, revolutions, uprisings and similar social events that had to end corruption of the centralized entities in an abrupt and violent fashion. Not because people are evil or violent, but because such corrupt entities can’t be shut down gracefully. Such entities can be shutdown only by force.\nSo why are we always repeating these scenarios? Why are we building these entities if we know they will become corrupt in time?\nThere are several social factors which are making us repeat these errors through history. Like, not learning about history in the first place, or because of human greed which is embeded in our biological existence. But one of the main reasons, however, is technological in nature. Simply put, people need money in order to transact and exchange value, but money needs to be governed, needs to be under someone’s management so that we can trust that it is genuine. Naturally, throughout history, such tasks have always been given to the most trusted authority and that is the government, or more recently, central banks. At first, everything works as intended, but then after some time, such entities become powerful because the nature of their task makes them important. And as they grow more and more powerful, they become more and more corrupt, until the circle is complete and everything begins once again.\nWhy is all this important? Well, for the first time in human history, we have a new technological solution which could end this loop of centralized entity creation and destruction. For the first time in human history, we have decentralized money which doesn’t require any entity at all in order to function. Finally, we have Bitcoin!\nSome of you might be aware of Bitcoin. Some of you have already heard this word. But do you really understand what it is? Do you really know how important Bitcoin is for humanity?\nOnce you start to think about this, your view of our world will never be the same, and that is something all Bitcoiners have experienced. As we call it, it is a trip to the rabbit hole. And this hole is deep, really deep. This hole goes beyond our society, it goes deep beyond all our social constructs, all our perceptions of civilized society and all our understanding of what it means to be human, to be free. No one truly understands yet what it means to have truly decentralized money, simply because this is the first time in our history that we have something like it. No one can yet try to fully grasp what it means to be independent of any government or dictatorship, to become a sovereign individual, what does it mean to be shielded from the corporation of institutions? What does it look like when you are truly free, when the fruits of your labor can’t be stolen, taken or inflated away?\nYou may think that I am writing about nonsense, and that none of that which I have said is true. But once you step in the rabbit hole and start to go down into it, you will see that you were wrong. Once you open your mind and truly think about what it means to have decentralized money, you will never look back to the old world. Once you taste Bitcoin, once you know true freedom, nothing will be the same again.\nThat is why Citadel-B was created! We hope to collect all the important articles and resources about Bitcoin and translate those into the Serbian language. Also, we hope to contribute some of our original works and give back to the Bitcoin community!\nTo be truly free takes time, it takes knowledge and constant struggle. Freedom is not a passive state, freedom is constantly fought for.\nBitcoin is a tool that can grant you freedom, but like any tool, it takes time to master it, it takes knowledge and practice to use it.\nWe hope to be the place which will collect all the relevant knowledge which will help you to master, perhaps the most important tool human kind has ever known.\nWe hope we will help you to master Bitcoin and become a sovereign individual!\n ❤️\n","wordCount":"909","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://citadel-b.com/img/avatarc.jpg","datePublished":"2022-02-19T16:36:21+01:00","dateModified":"2022-02-19T16:36:21+01:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Citadel - ₿"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://citadel-b.com/posts/citadel/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Citadel - ₿","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://citadel-b.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
